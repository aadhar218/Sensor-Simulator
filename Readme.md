SENSOR SIMULATOR using Javascript
The sensor simulator was build as a part of the internship project can be used to simulate multiple sensors for home automation as in a virtual factory setting.
The project can be used to virtually test different sensors and be used for development of different IOT projects.
Project Specifications:
1. The data from the sensors is currently accessed from a csv file which can be changed to get the data from the hardware by either transmitting to cloud.
2. The data from the file is transferred using the MQTT protocol.
3. Currently the simulator works on the node.js server at the localhost:4000
